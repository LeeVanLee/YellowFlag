# YellowFlag
Set of three Co-dependent packages, 
The heart of the project(YellowFlag2Go.aia is an android app w/ hard coded set of algorithms replicating a KNN neural-network, accomplished by recursively averaging datasets and storing locally, learns and labels in real time video(10 seconds seems to be enough), recognition of  visual data in seconds (about 2). #learnoptical3dinputinstant #realtimelearning
 Esp32 Micro-Controller (FullStringBendTemp)Harvests sensor data, for data abstraction/merge and transport over Bluetooth. //
OpenMV-cam Micro-Controller Running a set of Visual recognition algorithms, harvesting angular and physical measurements piping out over serial, to esp for Bluetooth out to Andriod/YellowFlag.///
